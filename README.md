## Description
The quotes app is an Angular web application that allows users to submit quotes and have them either upvoted or downvoted depending on whether they are inspirational or terrible. This is besides, displaying added quotes and an initial list of quotes. Aside from that, other functionalities added include creation of a quote by collecting form inputs, form validation, toggling of the form, deletion of a quote and highlighting the most upvoted quote.<br>
The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.1.
